    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm an early-career software developer
    and recent college graduate interested in positions related to Python
    development, data analysis, scientific computing, and web development.</p>

    <p>I learned the fundamentals of Python and Java programming while working
    as a Seismic Data Analyst for the US Air Force. After completing my
    enlistment, I studied Physics and Computer Science at California State
    University, Long Beach. I learned to blend both disciplines by learning how
    to simulate physical systems in Python and MATLAB.</p>

    <p>I'm now seeking a Software Developer job in California, particularly in
    the Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose regions. My strongest skillset is
    Python programming, but I'm also interested in opportunities related to
    Java and frontend web development.</p>
