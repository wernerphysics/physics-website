    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I've recently earned my
    Master's in Computational Physics and I'm looking forward to the next step in
    my career. I'm interested in software engineering and scientific
    computing jobs, particularly in roles which would leverage my strong
    background in data analysis and numerical computing. </p>

    <p>The foundation of my career is my four years in the US Air Force.
    As a Seismic Data Analyst at the <a href="https://www.16af.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1963049/air-force-technical-applications-center/">Air Force Technical Applications
    Center (AFTAC)</a>,
    I interpreted data from geophysical sensors across the globe in
    support of the Air Force's nuclear treaty monitoring mission. My role
    also allowed me to explore data engineering practices and
    streamlining of workflows with bash and Python scripts. </p>

    <p>After my military service, I studied physics at California State
    University Long Beach - first as an undergrad and then as a Master's
    candidate. My research in the group of <a
    href="https://www.csulb.edu/physics-astronomy/page/andreas-bill">Dr.
    Andreas Bill</a> concerns a particular arrangement of graphene known as
    twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG). The recent discovery of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26160"> superconductivity in
    TBLG</a> at certain "magic" twist
    angles defies easy explanation. My thesis, titled <i>The Plasmon Spectrum
    of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</i>, explores one possible explanation of
    this phenomenon in the form of acoustic plasmons. I developed
    high-performance Python code to compute the complex band structure of
    TBLG and characterize the behavior of plasmons in the system.</p>
