    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm an early-career software developer
    and recent college graduate with interests in Python development, scientific
    computing, and data science.</p>

    <p>I spent four years as a Seismic Data Analyst in the US Air Force, where I
    learned how to handle sensitive data in a professional environment. In the
    course of my work, I became proficient in Python and Java programming to
    facilitate data processing.  After completing my enlistment, I studied
    Physics and Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach. I
    learned to blend both disciplines by simulating physical systems in Python
    and MATLAB.</p>

    <p>I'm currently seeking a software development job, particularly one that
    would leverage my strong background in data analysis and Python scripting.
    I'm most interested in the Los Angeles area, but I'm willing to relocate to
    anywhere on the Pacific Coast to pursue a great opportunity.</p>
