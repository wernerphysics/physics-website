    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm a physics graduate student with
    interests in software engineering, scientific computing, and data
    science.</p>

    <p>I spent four years as a Seismic Data Analyst in the US Air Force, where I
    learned how to handle sensitive data in a professional environment. In the
    course of my work, I became proficient in Python and Java programming to
    facilitate data processing.  After completing my enlistment, I studied
    Physics and Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach. I
    learned to blend both disciplines by simulating physical systems in Python
    and MATLAB.</p>

    <p>When I complete my degree this summer, I'm looking for work in the software
      industry, especially in a position that would leverage my strong data analysis
      and scientific computing background.</p>
