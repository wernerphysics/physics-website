    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm a physics graduate student with
    interests in software engineering, scientific computing, and data
    science.</p>

    <p>I spent four years as a Seismic Data Analyst in the US Air Force, where I
    learned how to handle sensitive data in a professional environment. In the
    course of my work, I became proficient in Python and Java programming to
    facilitate data processing.  After completing my enlistment, I studied
    Physics and Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach. I
    learned to blend both disciplines by simulating physical systems in Python
    and MATLAB.</p>

    <p>I'm currently working on my Master's in Computational Physics. I'm
    looking for summer internships with the goal of transitioning to a
    full-time software engineer role when I earn my degree next year.</p>
