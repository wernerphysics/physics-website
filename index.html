    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm an early-career software developer
    and recent college graduate interested in positions related to Python
    development, data analysis, scientific computing, and web development.</p>

    <p>I spent four years as a Seismic Data Analyst in the US Air Force, where I
    gained a military sense of discipline and professionalism. As part of my
    work, I learned the basics of Python and Java programming to facilitate data
    processing.  After completing my enlistment, I studied Physics and Computer
    Science at California State University, Long Beach. I learned to blend both
    disciplines by simulating physical systems in Python and MATLAB.</p>

    <p>I'm now seeking a Software Developer job in California, particularly in
    the Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose regions. My strongest skillset is
    Python programming, but I'm also interested in opportunities related to
    Java and frontend web development.</p>
